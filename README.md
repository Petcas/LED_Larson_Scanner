# LED_Larson_Scanner


Uses the six Power Width Modulation ports {3,5,6,9,10,11} on an Arduino Uno to create a simple six LED Larson Scanner. Connect these six ports in order though 220 Ohm resisters to the Anode leg of the LED's.  Connect cathodes of LED's to GND port.

Change cycleWaitTime to speed up or slow down the scan rate. Larger is slower.
